# Vehicle Builder

## Our Task

We were given starter code that we had to update the typescript. This code will propt the usuer when started, if they wanted to build a new car or use an existing one.

## Description

* This application prompts the user for what vehicle they wanted to start with. Then it asks them what kind of car it is, color, make, etc. 

* The tools and technologies to accomplish this project:

  * `inquirer` for collecting user input
  * node is also needed
  * also using the import to call on other files in the folder
